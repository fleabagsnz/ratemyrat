  Frequently Asked Questions

  1. I can’t sign in. Make sure you’re using the same login method you
     originally chose.
  2. I made a purchase but don’t see it. Use “Restore Purchases” in the app,
     then contact support if it doesn’t appear.
  3. I can’t upload a rat. Check your internet connection and ensure the app has
     photo/storage permissions.
  4. Something looks wrong. Send us a brief description and a screenshot if
     possible.
